        <h1>Logos = mc<sup>2</sup></h1>

        <p>The modern world has turned Philosophy into Science, the pursuit of measurable knowledge. Natural Philosophy has become Natural Science; Metaphysics, Physical Science, and others just the same. In many cases, it seems, that early pre-Socratic philosophy may have provoked many modern ideals and discoveries. In one such agreement we will suggest that the philosopher Heraclitus (c.504-501BCE), and his proposed concept of logos and flux reflect a foundation in the law of mass-energy conservation, a constantly changing yet unifying understanding of the universe.
        Heraclitus comes to us through fragments and poetic riddle. Remnants quoted by other authors, or biographers of Greek philosophers, one such being Diogenes of Laertius. Diogenes presents reference to a single Heraclitic writing in a context On Nature.  This work was separated into three particular sections. The first, addressed the universe, another on politics, and finally theology. Considered obscure in his method of dialect, Heraclitus prompted riddled statements written is such a manner that these observatory statements seem to open many levels of interpretation.  Deciding the truth that lies within these ideas is particular to the pertinence of the coinciding conclusions. That is to say, we cannot be sure that Heraclitus wrote what Diogenes claims he has done so. If we are to believe that these fragments are in fact legitimate of Heraclitus, they are certainly up for debatable interpretations.</p>

        <p>Heraclitus is well known for his suggestion of what the universe is, and for Heraclitus the universe was an ever-changing subjective reality, held within the logos in a fluxuating fire of present. As in the whole of his writings, the coined word logos it self has a coded representation. Many have prospected that logos is “the word”, but for Heraclitus it was much more. For Heraclitus all things that take place or come to be done so in accordance with logos (fragment 10.1), which are common (fragment 10.2) both because it applies everywhere and also because it is objective, and so is available to all humans.  It is distinct from what people, even Heraclitus, say or think (fragment 10.47) so it is not a word, statement, account, or opinion but a true principle.
        By “the word”, Heraclitus simply means to suggest that it is as common and as graspable as any other named object. It is grounded by human commonality and ability to reason. Yet he believed that Humans will be unable to understand it, both before we hear of its existence and after. The rock is a rock because that is its name, its word. However the rock-ness has existed much longer than its name. Other names for Logos have been set such as, “formula”, “measure”, and often “reckoning”.
        Although Heraclitus offers various meanings of Logos, the idea of its interaction in principle stood for an all-encompassing harmonia, a yin and yang.  The rock is in existence because somewhere else the rock does not exist. Many of the fragments retained on Heraclitus explain this concept of often objects and ideas taken together are whole and not whole, being brought together and brought apart, in tune and out of tune; out of all things there comes a unity and out of a unity all things. (fragment 10:38).
        Logos could stand in percussive relation to modern scientific developments.   In particular there can be found many similarities between logos and the Law of Mass-Energy conservation as proposed by Einstein in the beginning of the 19th century.</p>

        <p>In, Einstein’s Law of Mass-Energy we can find these same Logos ideas are held within the compressed explanations of its development.  1785, Antoine Lavoisier, the father of modern chemistry, proposes that matter is neither created nor destroyed. Then later in 1842 we came to understand that energy is neither created nor destroyed as proposed by Julius Robert Mayer. These ideas of conservation are often referred to in relation to a “closed system”. A closed system could be perceived as Heraclitus view of time and the becoming where the instant was a closed duality of balance and contingency.</p>

        <p>
        In 1905, what has only been attributed as a recall of knowledge, Albert Einstein, will propose his mathematical formula E=mc<sup>2</sup> which states that the total amount of Mass and Energy in the universe is constant. Also known as equivalence, the idea for Einstein represented a constant connection of the two properties, mass and energy, having mass as a property of all energy, and energy as a property of all mass. It is a balance in metaphysical anti-realism, subjective realities that lead to Einstein’s suggestion of a 4th dimension allocated as time.

        Energy when removed from a system is retained and will in turn be added to any other system that absorbs it. Heraclitus may have presented this idea by proposing immortal mortals, mortal immortals, living the death of others and dying their life (fragment 10.89).  A statement that offers a circular exchange of Logos unlimited, as it is always present, never fading, only exchanged.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is that understanding that the particulars of the universe must be contained by unity.  Much as the way with how energy is created by the destruction of other energy, as it is returned for further use, yet never loosing its capacity all the while it is in constant exchange.  Looking at the universe as a closed system that contains the logos we may see the energy being dispersed. In fact Heraclitus deemed fire to be the logos, and perhaps that was simply because it was the best “word” for explaining such a concept during a time when the Homeric learning would have one believe in attributing such actions with the Gods.  Heraclitus gods were of war, “ War is father of all and king of all, and some he reveals as gods, others as men, one he makes slaves, others free”.  This war was his logos, the battle of the fire enveloping carnage as it extracted the life from an organic material, and emitting the light by which one could continuously agitate his kykeon while discussing weather the logos existed or not, all the while it was persisting.  For fire will advance and judge and convict all things (fragment 10.84). Heraclitus saw the fire as relatable evidence towards the principle of logos.  All things are an exchange for fire and fire for all things, as goods for gold and gold for goods (fragment 10.80). It was this idea that would become to be related as the flux, an ever-changing experience of life, where the same thing is both living and dead, and the waking and sleeping, and young and old; for these things transformed are those, and those transformed back again are these.
        </p>

        <p>
        Mass-Energy is contained in all as while it is most certain that one cannot pursue the notion of this existence as much as one could decipher the point of any circle being the beginning or the end of its circumference.  In science, once a theory cannot be agreed upon and evidence is proposed for either side of the argument we often revert to philosophy for extended reflection.
        </p>

        <p>
        According to Heraclitus all things are flowing.  He concluded this from the observation of nature as well as from the changes in society he lived in.  However, if all changes are irregular, science is impossible.  If science exists, there are regularities. (Physical, Metaphysical And Logical Thoughts About The Wave Equation And The Symmetry Of Space-Time pg.1-4) Differentials of this ever-changing world are however be rebutted by the existence of the logos and unifying one. We step into and we do not step into the same rivers (fragment 10.66).  Holding that in general everything is in a state of becoming and flux, and that nothing is stable, but that there is one substance, which persist, out of which these things have evolved. Although the waters change, the rivers remain the same.  Heraclitus understands change does support constancy as well.
        </p>

        <p>
        It must be brought forth that the state of conversions we are considering are much more general than the laws of motion. We are considering a homogonous whole.   Even in Science the laws of conservation hold true in physics and also chemistry. Heraclitus understood that continuous imperceptible change is an inference form the observation.  The bow and lyre appear static to the eyes, but if the string should snap that would be only the consequence of what the man who’s mind was not “ barbarian” would have known all the time.  They are at odds with the logos, with which above all they are in continuous contact, and the things they meet everyday appear strange to them. (Fragment 10.8)
        </p>

        <p>
        Taking these ideas simply because they have been stated would not be justified, as all knowledge must stand the test of constant challenge.  Zeno’s offers us an alternative way in understanding movement.  He begins by proposing at any moment the arrow occupies a space that is equal to its own size.  True.  Something that occupies a space equal to its own size is at rest. True.  Therefore, at each moment, the arrow is at rest.  True.  Concluding that movement is impossible.  Based on Parmenides ideas of the “One” Zeno suggest that change cannot occur.  Our senses are not to be trusted and the only truth is “being”.  Although they do not disagree that there is a one and a unity consisting of the universe, what they are insisting is that there is only that.  That what is is, and what is not is not.  This concept is an objective reality based on necessity, the mind, it is limited to only what is, and exist outside of time. This is simply because past, present, and future are the same.  Heraclitus has already made his statements in fact the logos is Parmenides “One”.  However Einstein may suggest that without the change and exchange of the particulars how would we ever know if what is truly is?  Challenging that the most difficult things to prove are often the ones in which we cannot see with our eyes, touch, or smell; instances that we cannot sense.

        <p>
        Listening not to me but to the Logos, it is wise to agree that all things are one (fragment 10.47).  Comparatively Energy is made of mass and mass of energy. All are of energy and none are not of mass. The road up and the road down are one in the same (fragment 10.63) Logos equals mc<sup>2</sup>.</p>
