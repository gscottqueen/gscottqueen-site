# The Possibility of Agreement in Aesthetic Judgments

If we consider a ‘universal’ as something common and everywhere, a truism; knowing for certian that it is difficult to provide the existence of any form of a ‘universal’, then we have to settle only for access to a ‘particular’, or an individual observance of a ‘universal’.

That's why universality of a particular will be visible subjective entities, at least to humans. David H. Hume, works out that standards of taste may develop out of a particular agreement to these terms, and later Immanuel Kant, suggested that we are easily observed making judgments, ones that seemingly are of taste but are presented as subjectively universal.

That all sounds very acadmeic, so let's think of it in a simple way. But before we get there, let's go back a bit.

The historical study of Aesthetics seems to have derived from David H. Hume’s essay, “On the Standard of Taste".  In this writing, Hume attempts to work out whether there is a distinct difference between “matters of taste”, and “matters of fact”. Just think of a ‘fact’ as something that can be proven about an object or idea. These facts could not be disputed, simply because they can be proven. But wait, what does that even mean, we cannot dispute ‘taste’!? We can certainly disagree on it as a ‘standard’ or ‘matter of fact’.  Even more than that, our personal 'taste' can be observed to share certain standards that are subjective in nature, but here we are we - speaking of them as if they are facts.

We present our matters of facts for objective empirical, even scientific measurements and laws.

> “The box is four feet by four feet square, it has given the room a sense of asymmetrical balance, revealing its feng shui.”

We can probably all agree, that based on the standard unit,the box is indeed a square measuring four feet on all sides. This ability to measure each side confirming the statement should lead one to a fact. And even though the second part of this statement may be agreed upon, in many ways we find ourselves imploring the absoluteness and entertaining that a suggestive and subjective observance of the box could be ‘fact’.

Back to Hume, who suggest that there is a distinction between “matters of fact” and “matters of taste”. This distinction for Hume is a “standard of taste”. Although the standard is variant, he issues a list of criteria necessary for establishing one.

To get at some ‘standard of taste’;

1. One must have a strong sense of the object, one that is united to delicate sentiment
2. The observer’s discovery will be improved by practice and perfected by comparison
3. There is an importance to be cleared of all prejudice

What is beautiful to one may not be to another.

Suppose we are to agree that a certain object _is_ beautiful, and then find that one’s sentiment of ‘beauty’ is not necessarily equal to another’s standard in comparison. If it were to have a strong sense of ‘beauty’ would it be true that person must have at some time interacted with some other entity that itself was inate in its beauty?

Think of it this way. A creature living all of its first years of life in the darkness arrives at the surface where the sunset shines bright upon its sensitive eyes. Has he not now encountered beauty? If he has had no comparing experience other than the dark, is he then only understanding that it is not the other but simply something different?

Let's propose that for one to have a strong sentiment of a standard not only should there be delicate sentiment, but it is not necessarily so that the comparison must be of the like kind. Humes standards could account from a ‘spokesperson’ who articulates the agreement, but are not expressing the cause of it. That is why Immanuel Kant approaches aesthetic judgment not as am empirical claim, but with the understanding of a subjective universality as a basis for agreement. It does seem contradictory for anything to be subjectively universal, but this is exactly what appears to be happening when we are making an aesthetic judgment.

> Making a judgment on beauty one may or may not know precisely what beauty is, or if the object that is being judged is beautiful only because it has been judged to be so.

For Kant, this is the first most crucial step in making an aesthetic judgment, and for this to not be so then the object could not be judged. Releasing oneself from prejudice is not possible. And if we are to agree with that, we may then also agree that Kants disinterestedness is necessary in pure aesthetic judgment. It is simply unclear whether the judgment or the feeling comes first. The idea is that beauty as a concept may be necessary for ones liking, but it is not sufficient to say that because one ‘likes’ something it is beautiful. Through the cognitive faculties such as logic, understanding, and imagination we should be able to arrive at a judgment without concepts.

Humes’ notion of an empirically established “standard of taste” makes sense of why a critique evaluation of an object would vary from one to the next. In order for us to arrive at an aesthetic judgment together, it is an A-Priori notion which allows for us to develop a disinterested account.

Art for Kant must be purposefully created yet remain purposive without purpose.

But why is it then that empirically evident universals and purities rarely if ever exist? While this seeming paradoxical occurrence can and often does happen it seems we most often arrive that the _probability of agreement_ is inherent in nature. It is as mathematicaly factual as understanding that the shear number of galaxies will produce more that one inteligent beings.
