# The Possibility of Agreement in Aesthetic Judgments

If we should consider a ‘universal’ as common everywhere, a truism; allowing that it is difficult to provide the existence of any form of a ‘universal’, one may then suggest that we have access to a ‘particular’, or an individual observance of said ‘universal’.  Seemingly the universality of a particular will be contributed most conclusively by its communicability to universal subjective entities, which are the human kind of beings. David H. Hume, will work out that standards of taste may develop out of a particular agreement of terms, and later Immanuel Kant, will suggest that it can be observed that we make judgments, ones that seemingly are of taste but are presented as subjectively universal.

The historical study of Aesthetics seems to have derived from David H. Hume’s essay, “On the Standard of Taste''.  In this writing, Hume attempts to work out whether there is a distinct difference between “matters of taste”, and “matters of fact”. One might consider a ‘fact’ as something that can be proven bout an object or idea. Seemingly, these facts could not be disputed for they most certainly can be proven. We should also consider how it is that we cannot dispute ‘taste’, even though we can disagree on it as a ‘standard’ or ‘matter of fact’.  Even more relevant, taste can be observed to share certain standards that are subjective in nature, yet we often speak of them as if they are facts.

We often reserve our matters of facts for objective empirical, even scientific measurements and laws. “The box is four feet by four feet square”, but we also might explain “the box has given the room a sense of asymmetrical balance, revealing its feng shui.”  We can all agree that in the first statement, based on the standard unit, that the box is indeed a square measuring four feet on all sides.  This ability to measure each side confirming the statement will lead one to the fact.  And even though the second statement may be agreed upon, in many ways we find ourselves imploring the absoluteness and entertaining such a suggestive and subjective observance of the box as ‘fact’.

Hume will suggest that there is a distinction between “matters of fact” and “matters of taste”. This distinction for Hume is a “standard of taste”. Although the standard is variant, he issues a list of criteria necessary for establishing one.  To get at some ‘standard of taste’ one must have a strong sense of the object, one that is united to delicate sentiment. The observer’s discovery will be improved by practice and perfected by comparison.  Perhaps the most difficult of tasks, Hume also considers there is an importance to be cleared of all prejudice when developing a “standard of taste”.

What is beautiful to one may on the other hand not stand as so to another.  Suppose we are to agree that a certain object is beautiful, and then find that one’s sentiment of ‘beauty’ is not necessarily equal to another’s standard in comparison. If one were to have a strong sense of ‘beauty’ would it be true that person must have at some time interacted with some other concern that inclined one to consider it beautiful?  One may consider that a youngling living all of its first years of life in the darkness soon arrives at the surface where the sunset shines bright upon the sensitive eyes.  Once capable of seeing the natural occurrences of the sun set in a shaded sky, are we to understand that he will not encounter beauty?  If he has had no comparing experience other than the dark, is he then only understanding that it is not the other but simply something different?

It might be understood that for one to have a strong sentiment of a standard not only should there be delicate sentiment, but it is not necessarily so that the comparison must be of the like kind.  Hume can be understood as viewing the standards to account from a ‘spokesperson’ who articulates the agreement, but are not expressing the cause.  Immanuel Kant will approach aesthetic judgment not as am empirical claim, but with the understanding of a subjective universality as a basis for agreement.  Kant it seems is offering that while it would be contradictory for anything to be subjectively universal, this is exactly what appears to be happening when we are making an aesthetic judgment.  He suggests that making a judgment on beauty one may or may not know precisely what beauty is, or if the object that is being judged is beautiful only because it has been judged to be so. He formulates this action into the relationship of being ‘disinterested’.

For Kant, this is the first most crucial step in making an aesthetic judgment, and for this to not be so then the object could not be judged.  It may be easily understood that releasing oneself from prejudice most often is not possible. If we are to agree with that, we may then also agree with Kant by understanding how disinterestedness is necessary in pure aesthetic judgment.   We might agree with Kant because it is unclear whether the judgment or the feeling comes first.

For Immanuel Kant, the characteristics of an aesthetic judgment begin with disinterestedness, and continue to a quantitative claim of universality in relation to necessity.  The idea is that beauty as a concept may be necessary for ones liking, but it is not sufficient to say that because one ‘likes’ something it is beautiful.  Kant feels that through the cognitive faculties such as logic, understanding, and imagination we should be able to arrive at a judgment without concepts.

Humes’ notion of an empirically established “standard of taste” makes sense of why a critique evaluation of an object would vary from one to the next. While an experiential telling of structured terms based, it does confront the universality of a judgment. In order for us to arrive at an aesthetic judgment together, Kant will suggest that it is an a priori notion that allows for us to develop a disinterested account. Art for Kant must be purposefully created yet remain purposive without purpose.  While this seeming paradoxical occurrence can and often does happen it seems Kant’s criteria is directed at the probability of agreement, which seems empirically evident as universals and purities rarely if ever exist.
