# Logos = mc<sup>2</sup>

If we look at the modern world we might recognize that it has turned Philosophy into Science, the pursuit of measurable knowledge. Natural Philosophy has become Natural Science; Metaphysics, Physical Science, and others just the same.

Even early pre-Socratic philosophy provoked modern ideals and discoveries. The philosopher Heraclitus (c.504-501BCE), and his proposed concept of logos and flux reflect a foundation in the law of mass-energy conservation. And as we already know, it is a constantly changing yet unifying understanding of the universe. The incredible thing to understand here, is that Heraclitus comes to us only through fragments and poetic riddle. Some remnants quoted by other authors or biographers of Greek philosophers.

Like Diogenes of Laertius. Diogenes presented a reference to a single Heraclitic writing in a context on Nature. The work was separated into three particular sections. The first, addressed the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology. Mostly considered obscure in his method of dialect, Heraclitus prompted riddled statement after riddled statment - written in such a manner that these observatory statements seem to open many levels of interpretation. We cannot be sure that Heraclitus wrote what Diogenes claims he has done so. But, if we are to believe that these fragments are in fact legitimate of Heraclitus, their insight are certainly up for serious consideration.

Heraclitus is well known for his suggestion of what the universe is. For this ancient philosopher,

> The universe was an ever-changing subjective reality, held within the logos in a fluctuating fire.

The coined word logos itself has a coded representation. Some prospect that logos is “the word”, but for Heraclitus, it seems it was much more.

> All things that take place or come to be done so in accordance with logos (fragment 10.1), which are common (fragment 10.2) both because it applies everywhere and also because it is objective, and so is available to all humans.

It is distinct from what people, even Heraclitus, say or think (fragment 10.47) so it is not a word, statement, account, or opinion but a true principle. By “the word”, Heraclitus simply means to suggest that it is as common and as graspable as any other named object. It is grounded by human commonality and the ability to reason.

Yet he believed that Humans will be unable to understand it, both before we hear of its existence and after. This is important. The rock is a rock because that is its name, its word. However, the rock-ness has existed much longer than its name.

Other names for Logos have been set such as, “formula”, “measure”, and often “reckoning”. Although Heraclitus offers various meanings of Logos, the idea of its interaction in principle geniuinley stood for an all-encompassing Harmonia, yin, and yang.

> The rock is in existence because somewhere else the rock does not exist.

Many of the fragments retained by Heraclitus explain this concept of objects and ideas taken together by being whole and not whole, being brought together and brought apart, in tune and out of tune; out of all things there comes unity and out of a unity all things. (fragment 10:38). It's really for this reason that Logos could stand in percussive relation to modern scientific developments.

Let consider one, the Law of Mass-Energy conservation as proposed by Einstein at the beginning of the 19th century.

In, Einstein’s Law of Mass-Energy we can find these same Logos ideas are held within the compressed explanations of its development. 1785, Antoine Lavoisier, the father of modern chemistry, proposes that matter is neither created nor destroyed. Then later in 1842, we came to understand that energy is neither created nor destroyed as proposed by Julius Robert Mayer. These ideas of conservation are often referred to in relation to a “closed system”. A closed system could be perceived as Heraclitus's view of time and the becoming where the instant was a closed duality of balance and contingency.

In 1905, what has only been attributed as a recall of knowledge, Albert Einstein, proposed his mathematical formula E=mc<sup>2</sup> which states that the total amount of Mass and Energy in the universe is constant. Also known as equivalence, the idea, whic for Einstein, represented a constant connection of the two properties, mass and energy. More specifically,

> having mass as a property of all energy, and energy as a property of all mass.

It is a balance in metaphysical anti-realism, subjective realities that lead to Einstein’s suggestion of a 4th dimension allocated as time. Energy, when removed from a system, is retained and will in turn be added to any other system that absorbs it. Heraclitus may have presented in his ramblings;

> immortal mortals, mortal immortals, living the death of others and dying their life (fragment 10.89).

A statement that offers a circular exchange of Logos unlimited, as it is always present, never fading, only exchanged.

It is that understanding that the particulars of the universe must be contained by unity. Much as the way with how energy is created by the destruction of other energy, as it is returned for further use, yet never losing its capacity all the while it is in constant exchange. Looking at the universe as a closed system that contains the logos we may see the energy being dispersed. In fact, Heraclitus deemed the fire to be the logos, and perhaps that was simply because it was the best “word” for explaining such a concept during a time when Homeric learning would have one believe in attributing such actions with the Gods.

Heraclitus gods were of war,

> "War is the father of all and king of all, and some he reveals as gods, others as men, one he makes slaves, others free".

This war was his logos, the battle of the fire enveloping carnage as it extracted the life from organic material, and emitting the light by which one could continuously agitate his kykeon (from the Greek "to mix, stir") while discussing whether the logos existed or not, all the while it was persisting.

> For fire will advance and judge and convict all things (fragment 10.84).

Heraclitus saw the fire as relatable evidence towards the principle of logos. It was this idea that would become to be related as the flux, an ever-changing experience of life, where the same thing is both living and dead, and the waking and sleeping, and young and old; for these things transformed are those, and those transformed back again are these.

Mass-Energy is contained in all as while it is almost certain that one cannot pursue the notion of this existence as much as one could decipher the point of any circle being the beginning or the end of its circumference. In science, once a theory cannot be agreed upon and evidence is proposed for either side of the argument we revert to philosophy for extended reflection.

According to Heraclitus, all things are flowing. He concluded this from the observation of nature as well as from the changes in society he lived in. However, if all changes are irregular, science is impossible. If science exists, there are regularities. (Physical, Metaphysical And Logical Thoughts About The Wave Equation And The Symmetry Of Space-Time pg.1-4) Differentials of this ever-changing world are however be rebutted by the existence of the logos and unifying one. We step into and we do not step into the same rivers (fragment 10.66). Holding that in general everything is in a state of becoming and flux, and that nothing is stable, but that there is one substance, which persists, out of which these things have evolved. Although the waters change, the rivers remain the same. Heraclitus understands change does support constancy as well.

The state of conversions we are considering here is much more general than the laws of motion. We are considering a homogonous whole. Even in Science, the laws of conservation hold true in physics and also chemistry. Heraclitus understood that continuous imperceptible change is an inference from the observation.

> The bow and lyre appear static to the eyes, but if the string should snap that would be only the consequence of what the man whose mind was not “ barbarian” would have known all the time. They are at odds with the logos, with which above all they are in continuous contact, and the things they meet every day appear strange to them. (Fragment 10.8)

The philosopher Zeno offers us an alternative way of understanding movement. He begins by proposing at any moment the arrow occupies a space that is equal to its own size.

True.
<br/>

Something that occupies a space equal to its own size is at rest.

True.
<br/>

Therefore, at each moment, the arrow is at rest.

True.
<br/>


But that would suggest movement is impossible and our senses are not to be trusted and the only truth is “being”. Although they do not disagree that there is a one and a unity consisting of the universe, what they are insisting on is that there is only that. That what is is, and what is not - is not. This concept is an objective reality based on necessity, the mind, it is limited to only what is, and exists outside of time. This is simply because past, present, and future are the same. Heraclitus has already made his statements in fact the logos is Parmenides “One”. However, Einstein may suggest that without the change and exchange of the particulars how would we ever know if what is true - is?

The most difficult things to prove are often the ones in which we cannot see with our eyes, touch, or smell; instances that we cannot sense. All things are one (fragment 10.47). Energy is made of mass and mass of energy. All are of energy and none are not of mass. The road up and the road down are one in the same (fragment 10.63)
