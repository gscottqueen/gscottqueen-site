  "description": "What is a moment? The word itself stands to be a nebulous description of everything and nothing at all, an indefinite interval of time. Moments can be fleeting, passing us by without notice. A moment can be recorded in history and celebrated for thousands of years. However, with all of its paradoxical descriptors, a moment will always be a precursor to what comes next.",
